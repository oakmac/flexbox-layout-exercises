## Problem #1 - "Holy Grail" Layout

Inside a file called `holy-grail.html`, create a [Holy Grail] layout using flexbox that resembles [this image].

**NOTE:** Due to the nature of this problem, there are many examples of this already done on the Internet. Honor system here; do not cheat. This is an example of a "real world" problem.

## Problem #3 - Piet Mondrian Painting

[Piet Mondrian] was a 20th century Dutch painter whose paintings emphasized simple geometric elements.

Inside a file called `mondrian.html`, create [this Piet Mondrian painting] using HTML and flexbox.

If you're having trouble creating the whole thing, pick a "chunk" of the painting and work on just that. Then pick another "chunk" and do that, etc. How can you combine your chunks into a single image? (think: HTML tree structure).

Some students have found printing the image and numbering each rectangle helpful.
